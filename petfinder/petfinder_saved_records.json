Everyone knows not to judge a book by its cover, so please remember that when you look at me. I'm a beefy boy with clipped ears, so some people might look at me and be intimidated, but the reality is that I'm as sweet as can be. The innocence in my eyes says it all. I'd like to have a home where I have a soft, comfy bed in the house, as I don't want to be simply relegated to the back yard. I want to be part of the family. I've already been house trained, so that shouldn't be a problem. I can sit on command, too. I'd need to be the only dog in my home, and if a family adopts me, the kids should be older. Please come visit me at the El Cajon Animal Shelter and find out just how wonderful I am.
